- Added support for multiple sound quality levels (high/med/low)
- Updated sound file paths to use separate files for each quality level:
  - `SRLU_high.ogg` for high quality
  - `SRLU_med.ogg` for medium quality (default)
  - `SRLU_low.ogg` for low quality
- Commands `/srlu high`, `/srlu med`, and `/srlu low` now properly switch between different sound files
- Updated CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect multiple sound file support
- Updated *.toc to support multiple WoW clients with single toc
